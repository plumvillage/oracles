    | And all the brothers too.
    | O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou.

#.

    | And enterprises of great pith and moment
    | Are melted into air, into thin air.

#.

    | O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,

    | Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
    | Against the stormy gusts of winter's day.

#.

    | And every fair from fair sometime declines, 
    | So we grow together, thorough bush, thorough brier.

#.

    | To take arms against a sea of troubles,
    | And by opposing end them?
    | We will unite the white rose and the red.

#.

    | These most brisk and giddy-paced times:
    | Is man no more than this? Consider him well.

    | Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
    | Calls back the lovely April of her prime:

    | Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers.

#.

    | For never-resting time leads summer on
    | The wheel is come full circle: I am here. 

#.

    | The undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns,
    | Two lovely berries moulded on one stem.

#.

    | They are the books, the arts, the academes,
    | And I serve the fairy queen. 

#.

    | Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep.
    | What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted?

    | Then wisely, good sir, weigh our sorrow with our comfort,
    | that ebb and flow by the moon.

    | All that glisters is not gold,
    | To plainness honour's bound when majesty falls to folly.

    | The quality of mercy is not strain'd.

#.

    | O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,
    | As full of spirit as the month of May.

#.

    | When I consider every thing that grows
    | Holds in perfection but a little moment,
    | Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
    | Hear a foot fall.

#.

    | With gentle conference, soft and affable.
    | Let your indulgence set me free.

#.

    | Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile; 
    | Now let not Nature's hand keep the wild flood confin'd!

#.

    | True, I talk of dreams, for there is nothing
    | Either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.
    
#.

    | What's in a name? that which we call a rose
    | Being once display'd doth fall that very hour.

#.

    | I'll teach you how to flow.
    | O, if you but knew how you the purpose cherish.

#.

    | What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
    | And being frank she lends to those are free.

#.

    | What's to come is still unsure: what's past is prologue, 
    | Present mirth hath present laughter.

#.

    | But thy eternal summer shall not fade
    | Is it a world to hide virtues in?

#.

    | I, thus neglecting worldly ends,
    | Play out the play.

#.

   | I stumbled when I saw: If it be now, 'tis not to come;
   | Our means secure us, and our mere defects prove our commodities.

#.

    | As painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth,
    | out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety.

#.

    | Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends;
    | Thou shalt be as free as mountain winds.

#.

    | Understanding begins to swell by prayer,
    | Which pierces so that it assaults
    | Mercy itself, and frees all faults.
 
#.

    | With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!
    | What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight?

#.

    | Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy
    | The very lifeblood of our enterprise.

#.

    | But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
    | And let the wise man fly:
    | To pay this debt of love but to a brother.

#.

    | And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another,
    | Swifter than the moon's sphere.

#.

    | Smiling at grief, awake, awake!
    | In delay there lies no plenty.

#.
    | And then the moon, like to a silver bow
    | Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest.

#.

    | And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,
    | Consideration like an angel came.

#.

    | When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    | There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.

#.

    | Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
    | To entrap the wisest.

#.

    | And as the morning steals upon the night,
    | Make me a willow cabin at your gate.

#.

    | Make the babbling gossip of the air cry out:
    | There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things.

#.

    | Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
    | As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest.

#.

    | Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
    | And deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll drown my book. 

#.

    | If of life you keep a care,
    | Shake off slumber, and beware.
    | You rub the sore,
    | When you should bring the plaster.

#.

    | Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded, 
    | The better part of valour is discretion.

#.

    | Draw the curtain close and let us all to meditation,
    | To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd moon.

#.
    | Their rising senses begin to chase
    | The ignorant fumes that mantle their clearer reason.
    | It is the quality o' th' climate.

#.

    | O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou!
    | Few in millions can speak like us.

#.

    | While you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
    | Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

#.

    | Burd'ned with like weight of pain,
    | Thou didst smile, infused with a fortitude from heaven.

#.

    | He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.
    | In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

#.

    | So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
    | Awake, dear heart, awake; thou hast slept well; Awake.
