#.

    | To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
    | On the curled clouds, [#]_
    | Whose speechless song being many, seems one. [#]_


#.

    | Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, [#]_
    | Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish. [#]_

#.

    | Be collected:
    | No more amazement: tell your piteous heart [#]_
    | Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee. [#]_

#.

    | So, ere you find where light in darkness lies, [#]_
    | Gentle breath of yours my sails must fill. [#]_

#.

    | Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many, [#]_
    | Both in your form and nobleness of mind. [#]_
    
#.

    | Now my charms are all o'erthrown, [#]_
    | Begot of nothing but vain fantasy. [#]_

#.

    | Look, whom she best endow'd she gave thee more; [#]_
    | Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm. [#]_
    
#.

    | Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, [#]_
    | Courage and hope both teaching him the practice. [#]_

#.

    | Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, [#]_
    | I'll kneel down, and ask of thee forgiveness. [#]_

#.

    | Hourly joys be still upon you! [#]_
    | And frame your mind to mirth and merriment. [#]_ 

#.

    | The moon new-bent in heaven, shall behold the night [#]_
    | That has such people in't! [#]_

#.

    | And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill, [#]_
    | Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel! [#]_
    
#.

    | Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where [#]_ 
    | Thaws and resolves itself into a dew. [#]_

#.

    | Their eyes do offices of truth, their words are natural breath, [#]_ 
    | all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind. [#]_

#.

    | Sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass [#]_
    | My heart is true as steel. [#]_

#.

    | Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: [#]_
    | I am sure care’s an enemy to life. [#]_

#.

    | Sermons in stones, and good in everything. [#]_
    | And therefore sit you down in gentleness. [#]_
    
#.

    | Have more than thou showest, 
    | Speak less than thou knowest, [#]_
    | Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st. [#]_

#.

    | What seest thou else
    | In the dark backward and abysm of time? [#]_
    | So full of shapes is fancy
    | That it alone is high fantastical. [#]_
    
#.

    | To give away yourself, keeps yourself still, [#]_
    | Make me a willow cabin at your gate. [#]_

#.

    | Those be rubies, fairy favors. [#]_
    | They sparkle still the right Promethean fire. [#]_
    
#.

    | Men must endure their going hence, even as their coming hither; [#]_
    | I am a fool to weep at what I am glad of. [#]_

#.

    | Get thee to a nunnery: [#]_
    | A contract of true love to celebrate. [#]_

#.

    | If music be the food of love, play on, [#]_
    | And let this world no longer be a stage. [#]_

#.

    | A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears: [#]_
    | The murmuring surge, that on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes. [#]_

#.

    | And manifest experience had collected [#]_
    | Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red. [#]_

#.

    | How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, [#]_
    | Merrily, merrily, shall I live now. [#]_

#.

    | These our actors,
    | As I foretold you, were all spirits and [#]_
    | Do make me give the lie to my true sight. [#]_
    
#.

    | With the help of your good hands. [#]_
    | All things in common nature should produce
    | Without sweat or endeavour. [#]_

#.

    | And some donation freely to estate [#]_
    | Under the blossom that hangs on the bough. [#]_

#.

    | Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not [#]_
    | In a cowslip's bell I lie. [#]_

#.

    | But that the dread of something after death, [#]_
    | It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven. [#]_ 

#.

    | And ye that on the sands with printless foot do chase the ebbing Neptune, [#]_
    | O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt. [#]_
 
#.

    | But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk [#]_
    | Out of the jaws of death. [#]_

#.

    | As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue, [#]_
    | Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love
    | Accompany your hearts! [#]_

#.

    | For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, [#]_
    | And kiss the lips of unacquainted change? [#]_

#.

    | Often have you heard that told: [#]_
    | Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
    | these gifts a curtain before 'em? [#]_

#.

    | And summer's lease hath all too short a date: [#]_
    | The hour's now come;
    | The very minute bids thee ope thine ear. [#]_

#.

    | I am all the daughters of my father's house,
    | And all the brothers too. [#]_
    | O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou. [#]_

#.

    | And enterprises of great pith and moment [#]_
    | Are melted into air, into thin air. [#]_

#.

    | O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, [#]_
    | If it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all. [#]_

#.

    | And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns [#]_
    | That show, contain and nourish all the world. [#]_

#.

    | Youth's a stuff will not endure. [#]_
    | Out of that no hope what great hope have you! [#]_

#.

    | And thus the native hue of resolution [#]_
    | Lies rich in virtue and unmingled. [#]_

#.

    | Happiness courts thee in her best array [#]_ 
    | And joy comes well in such a needy time. [#]_

#.

    | Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend, [#]_
    | Thy truth, then, be thy dower. [#]_

#.

    | Study is like the heaven's glorious sun, [#]_
    | Which touch'd the very virtue of compassion in thee. [#]_

#.

    | Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath [#]_
    | That long have frown'd upon their enmity! [#]_

#.

    | Give me your hands, if we be friends, [#]_
    | We are such stuff as dreams are made on. [#]_

#.

    | And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence. [#]_
    | Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase. [#]_

#.

    | I must go seek some dewdrops here [#]_
    | It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. [#]_

#.

    | I put you to the use of your own virtues. [#]_
    | All things are ready, if our minds be so. [#]_

#.

    | Now stand you on the top of happy hours, [#]_
    | Against the stormy gusts of winter's day. [#]_

#.

    | Let gentleness my strong enforcement be [#]_
    | To take a new acquaintance of thy mind. [#]_

#.

    | To take arms against a sea of troubles,
    | And by opposing end them? [#]_
    | Let it not enter in your mind of love. [#]_

#.

    | These most brisk and giddy-paced times: [#]_
    | Is man no more than this? Consider him well. [#]_

#.

    | Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers [#]_
    | Calls back the lovely April of her prime: [#]_
    | The form of my intent. [#]_ 

#.

    | It is a wise father that knows his own child. [#]_
    | Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
    | But yet an union in partition. [#]_

#.

    | In action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a god! [#]_
    | That the rude sea grew civil at her song. [#]_

#.

    | Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight, [#]_
    | Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace. [#]_

#.

    | The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune; [#]_
    | These blessed candles of the night. [#]_

#.

    | O, from what power hast thou this powerful might, [#]_
    | By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd? [#]_

#.

    | Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury, [#]_
    | Then to the elements be free, and fare thou well! [#]_

#.

    | The constancy and virtue of your love— [#]_
    | Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers. [#]_

#.

    | For never-resting time leads summer on [#]_
    | The wheel is come full circle: I am here. [#]_ 

#.

    | But how is it that this lives in thy mind, [#]_
    | The undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns? [#]_

#.

    | They are the books, the arts, the academes, [#]_
    | And I serve the fairy queen. [#]_ 

#.

    | Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep. [#]_
    | What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted? [#]_

#.

    | Then wisely, good sir, weigh our sorrow with our comfort, [#]_
    | that ebb and flow by the moon. [#]_

#.

    | All that glisters is not gold, [#]_
    | To plainness honour's bound when majesty falls to folly. [#]_

#.
    | Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy? [#]_
    | The quality of mercy is not strain'd. [#]_

#.

    | O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound, [#]_
    | As full of spirit as the month of May. [#]_

#.

    | When I consider every thing that grows
    | Holds in perfection but a little moment, [#]_
    | Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
    | Hear a foot fall. [#]_

#.

    | With gentle conference, soft and affable. [#]_
    | Let your indulgence set me free. [#]_

#.

    | Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile; [#]_ 
    | Now let not Nature's hand keep the wild flood confin'd! [#]_

#.

    | True, I talk of dreams, [#]_ for there is nothing
    | Either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. [#]_
    
#.

    | What's in a name? that which we call a rose [#]_
    | Being once display'd doth fall that very hour. [#]_

#.

    | O, if you but knew how you the purpose cherish! [#]_
    | If all were minded so, the times should cease. [#]_

#.

    | What is love? 'tis not hereafter; [#]_
    | And being frank she lends to those are free. [#]_

#.

    | What's to come is still unsure: [#]_ what's past is prologue, [#]_ 
    | Present mirth hath present laughter. [#]_

#.

    | And the moon changes even as your mind, [#]_
    | But thy eternal summer shall not fade. [#]_

#.

    | I, thus neglecting worldly ends, [#]_
    | Play out the play. [#]_

#.

    | Continue still in this so good a mind, [#]_
    | Wherein it finds a joy above the rest. [#]_

#.

    | To forswear the full stream of the world
    | and to live in a nook merely monastic; [#]_
    | And by my body's action teach my mind. [#]_

#.

    | Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends; [#]_
    | Thou shalt be as free as mountain winds. [#]_

#.

    | Understanding begins to swell [#]_ by prayer,
    | Which pierces so that it assaults
    | Mercy itself, and frees all faults. [#]_
 
#.

    | As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; [#]_
    | With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days! [#]_

#.

    | Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy [#]_
    | The very lifeblood of our enterprise. [#]_

#.

    | But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
    | And let the wise man fly: [#]_
    | To pay this debt of love but to a brother. [#]_

#.

    | And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another, [#]_
    | Swifter than the moon's sphere. [#]_

#.

    | Smiling at grief, [#]_ awake, awake! [#]_
    | In delay there lies no plenty. [#]_

#.
    | And then the moon, like to a silver bow [#]_
    | Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest. [#]_

#.

    | And as the morning steals upon the night, [#]_
    | Consideration like an angel came. [#]_

#.

    | When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, [#]_
    | There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple. [#]_

#.

    | Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, [#]_
    | To entrap the wisest. [#]_

#.

    | Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud, [#]_
    | I would you would make use of that good wisdom. [#]_

#.

    | Make the babbling gossip of the air cry out: [#]_
    | There are occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things. [#]_

#.

    | Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove: [#]_
    | As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest. [#]_

#.

    | For virtue and true beauty of the soul, [#]_
    | Halloo your name to the reverberate hills! [#]_ 

#.

    | But we in silence hold this virtue well: [#]_
    | The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie. [#]_

#.

    | Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded, [#]_ 
    | The better part of valour is discretion. [#]_

#.

    | Draw the curtain close and let us all to meditation, [#]_
    | To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd moon. [#]_

#.
    | My crown is call'd content;
    | A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy. [#]_
    | Silence bestows that virtue on it. [#]_

#.

    | Time travels in divers paces with divers persons, [#]_
    | And, since I saw thee, th' affliction of my mind amends. [#]_

#.

    | When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear, [#]_
    | These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear. [#]_

#.

    | Burd'ned with like weight of pain, [#]_
    | Thou didst smile, infused with a fortitude from heaven. [#]_

#.

    | This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, [#]_
    | Was it not to refresh the mind of man? [#]_

#.

    | So shaken as we are, so wan with care, [#]_
    | Awake, dear heart, awake; thou hast slept well; Awake. [#]_

#.

    | Enforce attention like deep harmony. [#]_
    | You shall find your safety manifested. [#]_

#.

    | Hath not in nature's mystery more science [#]_
    | To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy? [#]_

#.

    | How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature! [#]_
    | Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. [#]_

#.

    | I will believe thou hast a mind that suits [#]_
    | And may enjoy such quiet walks as these. [#]_

#.

    | Who doth ambition shun,
    | And loves to live i' th' sun, [#]_
    | He finds the joys of heaven here on earth. [#]_

#.

    | Enjoy thy plainness;
    | It nothing ill becomes thee. [#]_
    | For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich. [#]_

#.

    | Crowning the present, doubting of the rest? [#]_
    | Keep unshak'd that temple, thy fair mind. [#]_

#.

    | Unlooked for joy in that I honour most; [#]_
    | Your bounty, virtue, fair humility. [#]_

#.

    | Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things: [#]_
    | Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain. [#]_

#.

    | For virtue's office never breaks men's troth, [#]_
    | Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste. [#]_

#.

    | As Nature was in making graces dear, [#]_
    | Then happy I that love and am beloved. [#]_

#.

    | You bear a gentle mind, and heav'nly blessings
    | Follow such creatures. [#]_
    | Steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution. [#]_

#.

    | Do not infest your mind with beating on
    | The strangeness of this business; [#]_
    | It is the purpose that makes strong the vow. [#]_

#.

    | A turn or two I'll walk to still my beating mind. [#]_
    | My crown is in my heart, not on my head. [#]_

#.

    | That love which virtue begs and virtue grants [#]_
    | Is true of mind and made of no such baseness. [#]_

#.

    | Your patience and your virtue well deserves it. [#]_
    | That every eye which in this forest looks
    | Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where. [#]_

#.

    | Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace; [#]_
    | And take thou my oblation, poor but free. [#]_

#.

    | To make you understand this in a manifested effect, [#]_
    | Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now. [#]_

#.

    | The purest spring is not so free from mud; [#]_
    | It is the show and seal of nature's truth. [#]_

#.

    | Comets, importing change of times and states, [#]_
    | O infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from
    | The world's great snare uncaught? [#]_

#.

    | The very virtue of compassion in thee, [#]_
    | Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love. [#]_

#.

    | You see how all conditions, how all minds
    | Tender down their services. [#]_
    | Silence is the perfectest herald of joy. [#]_

#.

    | All of one nature, of one substance bred, [#]_
    | When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile! [#]_

#.

    | Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind, [#]_
    | Then music with her silver sound
    | With speedy help doth lend redress. [#]_

#.

    | An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds [#]_
    | Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground. [#]_

#.

    | One feast, one house, one mutual happiness! [#]_
    | With profits of the mind, study and fast. [#]_

#.

    | The griefs are ended by seeing the worst [#]_
    | Then sigh not so, but let them go. [#]_

#.

    | To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell [#]_
    | The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer. [#]_

#.

    | Through the forest I have gone, [#]_
    | To make some special instance special-blest. [#]_

#.

    | Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, [#]_
    | I'll be as patient as a gentle stream. [#]_

#.      

    | For I must tell you friendly in your ear: [#]_
    | The forest walks are wide and spacious. [#]_

#.

    | As plays the sun upon the glassy streams, [#]_
    | Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth. [#]_

#.

    | Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing [#]_
    | 'The more I give to thee, the more I have.' [#]_

#.

    | The sea all water, yet receives rain still, [#]_
    | God be thank'd, there is no need of me. [#]_

#.

    | Out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety [#]_
    | And make us heirs of all eternity. [#]_

#.

    | That's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion. [#]_
    | Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound to pity too. [#]_

#.

    | Full many a glorious morning have I seen [#]_
    | For I impair not beauty being mute. [#]_

#.

    | A little fire is quickly trodden out, [#]_
    | All losses are restored, and sorrows end. [#]_

#.

    | My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love. [#]_
    | In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them. [#]_

#.

    | Let's take the instant by the forward top [#]_
    | And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time. [#]_

#.

    | One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest. [#]_
    | A kingdom for it was too small a bound. [#]_

#.

    | With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems [#]_
    | Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross. [#]_

#.

    | Sweet are the uses of adversity, [#]_
    | Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet. [#]_

#.

    | Men of great worth resorted to this forest, [#]_
    | As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea. [#]_
