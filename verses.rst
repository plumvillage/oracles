    | On the curled clouds, [#]_
    | Whose speechless song being many, seems one. [#]_


#.

    | Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, [#]_
    | Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish. [#]_

#.

    | Be collected:
    | No more amazement: tell your piteous heart [#]_
    | Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee. [#]_

#.

    | I saw him beat the surges under him, 
    | And ride upon their backs; he trod the water. [#]_

#.

    | Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many, [#]_
    | And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
    | At gilded butterflies. [#]_
    
#.

    | Now my charms are all o'erthrown, [#]_
    | Begot of nothing but vain fantasy. [#]_

#.

    | Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more; [#]_
    | Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm. [#]_
    
#.

    | Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, [#]_
    | Courage and hope both teaching him the practice. [#]_

#.

    | Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, [#]_
    | I'll kneel down, and ask of thee forgiveness. [#]_

#.

    | Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.' [#]_
    | All the world's a stage. [#]_ 

#.

    | The moon new-bent in heaven, shall behold the night [#]_
    | That has such people in't! [#]_

#.

    | And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill, [#]_
    | Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel! [#]_
    
#.

    | Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where [#]_ 
    | Thaws and resolves itself into a dew. [#]_

#.

    | We make guilty of our
    | disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
    | if we were villains by necessity; fools by
    | heavenly compulsion. [#]_

#.

    | Sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass [#]_
    | My heart is true as steel. [#]_

#.

    | Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: [#]_
    | I am sure careâ€™s an enemy to life. [#]_

#.

    | You have often 
    | Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd [#]_
    | Conceal me what I am, and be my aid. [#]_
    
#.

    | Have more than thou showest, 
    | Speak less than thou knowest, [#]_
    | Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st. [#]_

#.

    | What seest thou else
    | In the dark backward and abysm of time? [#]_
    | So full of shapes is fancy
    | That it alone is high fantastical. [#]_
    
#.

    | To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
    | And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill. [#]_

#.

    | Those be rubies, fairy favors. [#]_
    | They sparkle still the right Promethean fire. [#]_
    
#.

    | Men must endure their going hence,
    | even as their coming hither; ripeness is all. [#]_

#.

    | Get thee to a nunnery: [#]_
    | A contract of true love to celebrate. [#]_

#.

    | She sat like Patience on a monument,
    | Smiling at grief. [#]_

#.

    | A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears: [#]_
    | The murmuring surge, that on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes. [#]_

#.

    | No traveller returns, puzzles the will [#]_
    | If it be not to come, it will be now. [#]_

#.

    | How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, [#]_
    | Merrily, merrily, shall I live now. [#]_

#.

    | These our actors,
    | As I foretold you, were all spirits and [#]_
    | Do make me give the lie to my true sight. [#]_
    
#.

    | The art of our necessities is strange,
    | That can make vile things precious. [#]_

#.

    | And some donation freely to estate [#]_
    | Under the blossom that hangs on the bough. [#]_

#.

    | Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not [#]_
    | In a cowslip's bell I lie. [#]_

#.

    | But that the dread of something after death, [#]_
    | It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven. [#]_ 

#.

    | What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! [#]_
    | Space enough have I in such a prison. [#]_

#.

    | But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk [#]_
    | Out of the jaws of death. [#]_

#.

    | Misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows [#]_
    | Which are the children of an idle brain. [#]_

#.

    | For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, [#]_
    | That show, contain and nourish all the world. [#]_

#.

    | Often have you heard that told: [#]_
    | Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
    | these gifts a curtain before 'em? [#]_

#.

    | And summer's lease hath all too short a date: [#]_
    | The hour's now come;
    | The very minute bids thee ope thine ear. [#]_

#.

    | I am all the daughters of my father's house,
    | And all the brothers too. [#]_
    | O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou. [#]_

#.

    | And enterprises of great pith and moment [#]_
    | Are melted into air, into thin air. [#]_

#.

    | O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, [#]_
    | If it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all. [#]_

#.

    | There's no harm done. [#]_
    | Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. [#]_

#.

    | For such disguise as haply shall become [#]_
    | How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable! [#]_

#.

    | And thus the native hue of resolution [#]_
    | Strikes where it doth love. [#]_

#.

    | Gentles, do not reprehend: [#]_ nothing but to show you
    | How a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar. [#]_

#.

    | Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
    | Thy truth, then, be thy dower. [#]_

#.

    | I have no way, and therefore want no eyes; [#]_
    | To follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions. [#]_

#.

    | Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath [#]_
    | That long have frown'd upon their enmity! [#]_

#.

    | Give me your hands, if we be friends, [#]_
    | We are such stuff as dreams are made on. [#]_

#.

    | And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence. [#]_
    | Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase. [#]_

#.

    | I must go seek some dewdrops here [#]_
    | It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. [#]_

#.

    | Let Hercules himself do what he may, [#]_
    | If you pardon, we will mend. [#]_

#.

    | Now stand you on the top of happy hours, [#]_
    | Against the stormy gusts of winter's day. [#]_

#.

    | And every fair from fair sometime declines,  [#]_
    | So we grow together, [#]_ thorough bush, thorough brier. [#]_

#.

    | To take arms against a sea of troubles,
    | And by opposing end them? [#]_
    | We will unite the white rose and the red. [#]_

#.

    | These most brisk and giddy-paced times: [#]_
    | Is man no more than this? Consider him well. [#]_

#.

    | Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers [#]_
    | Calls back the lovely April of her prime: [#]_
    | The form of my intent. [#]_ 

#.

    | It is a wise father that knows his own child. [#]_
    | Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
    | But yet an union in partition. [#]_

#.

    | In action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a god! [#]_
    | That the rude sea grew civil at her song. [#]_

#.

    | When sorrows come, they come not single spies [#]_
    | And swear that brightness doth not grace the day. [#]_

#.

    | The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune; [#]_
    | These blessed candles of the night. [#]_

#.

    | O, from what power hast thou this powerful might, [#]_
    | By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd? [#]_

#.

    | 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; it is nor hand, nor foot, 
    | Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man. [#]_

#.

    | My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. [#]_
    | Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers. [#]_

#.

    | For never-resting time leads summer on [#]_
    | The wheel is come full circle: I am here. [#]_ 

#.

    | The undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns, [#]_
    | Two lovely berries moulded on one stem. [#]_

#.

    | They are the books, the arts, the academes, [#]_
    | And I serve the fairy queen. [#]_ 

#.

    | With the help of your good hands [#]_
    | The cowslips tall her pensioners be. [#]_

#.

    | We'll wear out,
    | In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
    | That ebb and flow by the moon. [#]_

#.

    | All that glisters is not gold, [#]_
    | To plainness honour's bound when majesty falls to folly. [#]_

#.
    | Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy? [#]_
    | The quality of mercy is not strain'd. [#]_

#.

    | Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
    | Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy. [#]_

#.

    | When I consider every thing that grows
    | Holds in perfection but a little moment, [#]_
    | Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
    | Hear a foot fall. [#]_

#.

    | Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury
    | Do I take part: the rarer action is
    | In virtue than in vengeance. [#]_

#.

    | For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
    | But to the earth some special good doth give, [#]_

#.

    | True, I talk of dreams, [#]_ for there is nothing
    | Either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. [#]_
    
#.

    | What's in a name? that which we call a rose
    | By any other name would smell as sweet. [#]_

#.

    | Gentle breath of yours my sails [#]_
    | Must I hold a candle to my shames? [#]_

#.

    | What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
    | Present mirth hath present laughter. [#]_

#.

    | What's to come is still unsure: 
    | In delay there lies no plenty; [#]_

#.

    | But thy eternal summer shall not fade [#]_
    | Is it a world to hide virtues in? [#]_

#.

    | I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
    | To closeness and the bettering of my mind. [#]_

#.

   | I stumbled when I saw: [#]_ If it be now, 'tis not to come; [#]_
   | Our means secure us, and our mere defects prove our commodities. [#]_

#.

    | Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
    | And being frank she lends to those are free. [#]_

#.

    | Some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone
    | And most poor matters point to rich ends. [#]_

#.

    | O, I have suffered with those that I saw suffer: [#]_
    | The seeming truth which cunning times put on. [#]_

#.

    | Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, [#]_
    | But release me from my bands. [#]_

#.

    | That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
    | And follows but for form,
    | Will pack when it begins to rain,
    | And leave thee in the storm. [#]_

#.

    | But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
    | And let the wise man fly:
    | The knave turns fool that runs away;
    | The fool no knave, pardie. [#]_

#.

    | Swifter than the moon's sphere;
    | To dew her orbs upon the green. [#]_

#.

    | If of life you keep a care,
    | Shake off slumber, and beware:
    | Awake, awake! [#]_

#.
    | And then the moon, like to a silver bow [#]_
    | Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest. [#]_

#.

    | But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
    | Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel. [#]_

#.

    | When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, [#]_
    | There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple. [#]_

#.

    | Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, [#]_
    | To entrap the wisest. [#]_

#.

    | Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
    | And call upon my soul within the house. [#]_

#.

    | Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
    | And make the babbling gossip of the air
    | Cry out. [#]_

#.

    | Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove: [#]_
    | As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest. [#]_
