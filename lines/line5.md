Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
Sonnet 98

Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
    To pity too.
IACHIMO.

Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing
Pandarus.

Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
Sonnet 60.

Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,
Sonnet 127

When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
Sonnet 54

One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
Pandulph

Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
Richard
