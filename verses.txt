Whose speechless song being many, seems one.

Gentle breath of yours my sails must fill.

Both in your form and nobleness of mind.

All dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind.

My heart is true as steel.

I am sure care’s an enemy to life.

Make me a willow cabin at your gate.

Out of the jaws of death.

Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts!

Against the stormy gusts of winter's day.

To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.

Is man no more than this? Consider him well.

57. Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
Calls back the lovely April of her prime: the form of my intent.

By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd?

Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers.

The wheel is come full circle: I am here.

The undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns?

And I serve the fairy queen.

What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted?

that ebb and flow by the moon.

To plainness honour's bound when majesty falls to folly.

71. Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy?
The quality of mercy is not strain'd.

72. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,
As full of spirit as the month of May.

Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall.

Let your indulgence set me free.

But thy eternal summer shall not fade.

Play out the play.

83. Continue still in this so good a mind,
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest.

84. To forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic;
And by my body's action teach my mind.

Thou shalt be as free as mountain winds.

86. Understanding begins to swell by prayer, which pierces so
That it assaults mercy itself, and frees all faults.

With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!

88. Th'endeavour of this present breath may buy
The very lifeblood of our enterprise.

To pay this debt of love but to a brother.

Swifter than the moon's sphere.

Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest.

As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest.

99. For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills!

The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie.

101. Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
The better part of valour is discretion.

102. Draw the curtain close and let us all to meditation,
To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd moon.

And may enjoy such quiet walks as these.

Keep unshak'd that temple, thy fair mind.

116. Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility.

117. Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things:
Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain.

Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste.

119. As Nature was in making graces dear,
Then happy I that love and am beloved.

120. You bear a gentle mind, and heav'nly blessings follow such creatures.
Steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution. 

121. Do not infest your mind with beating on the strangeness of this business;
It is the purpose that makes strong the vow.

122. A turn or two I'll walk to still my beating mind.
My crown is in my heart, not on my head.

And take thou my oblation, poor but free.

126. To make you understand this in a manifested effect,
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.

It is the show and seal of nature's truth.

O infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from
The world's great snare uncaught?

129. The very virtue of compassion in thee,
Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.

130. You see how all conditions, how all minds tender down their services.
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy.

131. All of one nature, of one substance bred,
When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!

132. Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind,
Then music with her silver sound with speedy help doth lend redress.

133. An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground.

134. One feast, one house, one mutual happiness!
With profits of the mind, study and fast.

135. The griefs are ended by seeing the worst
Then sigh not so, but let them go.

136. To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer.

137. Through the forest I have gone,
To make some special instance special-blest.

138. Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream.

The forest walks are wide and spacious.

Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.

'The more I give to thee, the more I have.'

For I impair not beauty being mute.

All losses are restored, and sorrows end.

147. My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.
In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them.

148. Let's take the instant by the forward top
And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time.

149. One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
A kingdom for it was too small a bound.

150. With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross.

151. Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet.

152. Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea.
