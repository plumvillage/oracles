#. 

    | To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride on the curled clouds,[^1]
    | Whose speechless song being many, seems one.[^2]

#. 

    | Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,[^3]
    | Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish.[^4]

#. 

    | Be collected; no more amazement. Tell your piteous heart:[^5]
    | Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee.[^6]

#. 

    | So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,[^7]
    | Gentle breath of yours my sails must fill.[^8]

#. 

    | Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,[^9]
    | Both in your form and nobleness of mind.[^10]

#. 

    | Now my charms are all o'erthrown,[^11]
    | Begot of nothing but vain fantasy.[^12]

#. 

    | Look, whom she best endow'd she gave thee more;[^13]
    | Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm.[^14]

#. 

    | Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,[^15]
    | Courage and hope both teaching him the practice.[^16]

#. 

    | Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.[^17]
    | I'll kneel down, and ask of thee forgiveness.[^18]

#. 

    | Hourly joys be still upon you![^19]
    | And frame your mind to mirth and merriment.[^20]

#. 

    | The moon new-bent in heaven, shall behold the night[^21]
    | That has such people in't![^22]

#. 

    | And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,[^23]
    | Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel![^24]

#. 

    | Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where[^25]
    | Thaws and resolves itself into a dew.[^26]

#. 

    | Their eyes do offices of truth, their words are natural breath,
   [^27]
    | All dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind.[^28]

#. 

    | Sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass:[^29]
    | My heart is true as steel.[^30]

#. 

    | Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel;[^31]
    | I am sure care’s an enemy to life.[^32]

#. 

    | Sermons in stones, and good in everything—[^33]
    | And therefore sit you down in gentleness.[^34]

#. 

    | Have more than thou showest, speak less than thou knowest,[^35]
    | Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st.[^36]

#. 

    | What seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time?[^37]
    | So full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical.[^38]

#. 

    | To give away yourself, keeps yourself still.[^39]
    | Make me a willow cabin at your gate.[^40]

#. 

    | Those be rubies, fairy favors;[^41]
    | They sparkle still the right Promethean fire.[^42]

#. 

    | Men must endure their going hence, even as their coming hither.[^43]
    | I am a fool to weep at what I am glad of.[^44]

#. 

    | Get thee to a nunnery:[^45]
    | A contract of true love to celebrate.[^46]

#. 

    | If music be the food of love, play on,[^47]
    | And let this world no longer be a stage.[^48]

#. 

    | A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears:[^49]
    | The murmuring surge, that on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes.[^50]

#. 

    | And manifest experience had collected[^51]
    | Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red.[^52]

#. 

    | How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,[^53]
    | Merrily, merrily, shall I live now.[^54]

#. 

    | These our actors, as I foretold you, were all spirits and[^55]
    | Do make me give the lie to my true sight.[^56]

#. 

    | With the help of your good hands[^57] all things in common nature
    | Should produce without sweat or endeavour.[^58]

#. 

    | And some donation freely to estate[^59]
    | Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.[^60]

#. 

    | Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not:[^61]
    | In a cowslip's bell I lie.[^62]

#. 

    | But that the dread of something after death[^63]
    | It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven.[^64]

#. 

    | And ye that on the sands with printless foot
    | Do chase the ebbing Neptune—[^65]
    | O, let me see thee walk! Thou dost not halt.[^66]

#. 

    | But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk[^67]
    | Out of the jaws of death.[^68]

#. 

    | As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,[^69]
    | Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts![^70]

#. 

    | For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,[^71]
    | And kiss the lips of unacquainted change?[^72]

#. 

    | Often have you heard that told:[^73] Wherefore are these things hid? 
    | Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em?[^74]

#. 

    | And summer's lease hath all too short a date:[^75]
    | The hour's now come; the very minute bids thee ope thine ear.[^76]

#. 

    | I am all the daughters of my father's house, and all the brothers too.[^77]
    | O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou.[^78]

#. 

    | And enterprises of great pith and moment[^79]
    | Are melted into air, into thin air.[^80]

#. 

    | O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,[^81]
    | If it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all.[^82]

#. 

    | And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns[^83]
    | That show, contain and nourish all the world.[^84]

#. 

    | Youth's a stuff will not endure;[^85]
    | Out of that no hope what great hope have you![^86]

#. 

    | And thus the native hue of resolution[^87]
    | Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.[^88]

#. 

    | Happiness courts thee in her best array[^89]
    | And joy comes well in such a needy time.[^90]

#. 

    | Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend;[^91]
    | Thy truth, then, be thy dower.[^92]

#. 

    | Study is like the heaven's glorious sun,[^93]
    | Which touch'd the very virtue of compassion in thee.[^94]

#. 

    | Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath[^95]
    | That long have frown'd upon their enmity![^96]

#. 

    | Give me your hands, if we be friends;[^97]
    | We are such stuff as dreams are made on.[^98]

#. 

    | And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence—[^99]
    | Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase.[^100]

#. 

    | I must go seek some dewdrops here;[^101]
    | It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.[^102]

#. 

    | I put you to the use of your own virtues.[^103]
    | All things are ready, if our minds be so.[^104]

#. 

    | Now stand you on the top of happy hours,[^105]
    | Against the stormy gusts of winter's day.[^106]

#. 

    | Let gentleness my strong enforcement be[^107]
    | To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.[^108]

#. 

    | To take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?[^109]
    | Let it not enter in your mind of love.[^110]

#. 

    | These most brisk and giddy-paced times:[^111]
    | Is man no more than this? Consider him well.[^112]

#. 

    | Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers[^113]
    | Calls back the lovely April of her prime:[^114] the form of my intent.[^115]

#. 

    | It is a wise father that knows his own child,[^116]
    | Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, but yet an union in partition.[^117]

#. 

    | In action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a god,
   [^118]
    | That the rude sea grew civil at her song.[^119]

#. 

    | Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.[^120]
    | Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace.[^121]

#. 

    | The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune—[^122]
    | These blessed candles of the night.[^123]

#. 

    | O, from what power hast thou this powerful might,[^124]
    | By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd?[^125]

#. 

    | Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury,[^126]
    | Then to the elements be free, and fare thou well![^127]

#. 

    | The constancy and virtue of your love—[^128]
    | Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers.[^129]

#. 

    | For never-resting time leads summer on—[^130]
    | The wheel is come full circle: I am here.[^131]

#. 

    | But how is it that this lives in thy mind,[^132]
    | The undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns?
   [^133]

#. 

    | They are the books, the arts, the academes—[^134]
    | And I serve the fairy queen.[^135]

#. 

    | Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep.[^136]
    | What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted?[^137]

#. 

    | Then wisely, good sir, weigh our sorrow with our comfort,[^138]
    | That ebb and flow by the moon.[^139]

#. 

    | All that glisters is not gold. To plainness honour's bound[^140]
    | When majesty falls to folly.[^141]

#. 

    | Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy?[^142]
    | The quality of mercy is not strain'd.[^143]

#. 

    | O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,[^144]
    | As full of spirit as the month of May.[^145]

#. 

    | When I consider every thing that grows
    | Holds in perfection but a little moment—[^146]
    | Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall.[^147]

#. 

    | With gentle conference, soft and affable,[^148]
    | Let your indulgence set me free.[^149]

#. 

    | Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile;[^150]
    | Now let not Nature's hand keep the wild flood confin'd![^151]

#. 

    | True, I talk of dreams,[^152] for there is nothing
    | Either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.[^153]

#. 

    | What's in a name? that which we call a rose[^154]
    | Being once display'd doth fall that very hour.[^155]

#. 

    | O, if you but knew how you the purpose cherish![^156]
    | If all were minded so, the times should cease.[^157]

#. 

    | What is love? 'tis not hereafter,[^158]
    | And being frank she lends to those are free.[^159]

#. 

    | What's to come is still unsure;[^160] what's past is prologue.[^161]
    | Present mirth hath present laughter.[^162]

#. 

    | And the moon changes even as your mind,[^163]
    | But thy eternal summer shall not fade.[^164]

#. 

    | I, thus neglecting worldly ends,[^165]
    | Play out the play.[^166]

#. 

    | Continue still in this so good a mind,[^167]
    | Wherein it finds a joy above the rest.[^168]

#. 

    | To forswear the full stream of the world
    | And to live in a nook merely monastic[^169]
    | And by my body's action teach my mind.[^170]

#. 

    | Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends;[^171]
    | Thou shalt be as free as mountain winds.[^172]

#. 

    | Understanding begins to swell [^173] by prayer, which pierces so
    | That it assaults mercy itself, and frees all faults.[^174]

#. 

    | As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well,[^175]
    | With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days![^176]

#. 

    | Th'endeavour of this present breath may buy[^177]
    | The very lifeblood of our enterprise.[^178]

#. 

    | But I will tarry; the fool will stay, and let the wise man fly,[^179]
    | To pay this debt of love but to a brother.[^180]

#. 

    | And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another,[^181]
    | Swifter than the moon's sphere.[^182]

#. 

    | Smiling at grief:[^183] Awake, awake![^184]
    | In delay there lies no plenty.[^185]

#. 

    | And then the moon, like to a silver bow[^186]
    | Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest.[^187]

#. 

    | And as the morning steals upon the night,[^188]
    | Consideration like an angel came.[^189]

#. 

    | When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,[^190]
    | There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.[^191]

#. 

    | Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,[^192]
    | To entrap the wisest.[^193]

#. 

    | Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud—[^194]
    | I would you would make use of that good wisdom.[^195]

#. 

    | Make the babbling gossip of the air cry out:[^196]
    | 'There are occasions and causes, why and wherefore in all things!'
   [^197]

#. 

    | Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:[^198]
    | As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest.[^199]

#. 

    | For virtue and true beauty of the soul,[^200]
    | Halloo your name to the reverberate hills![^201]

#. 

    | But we in silence hold this virtue well:[^202]
    | The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie.[^203]

#. 

    | Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,[^204]
    | The better part of valour is discretion.[^205]

#. 

    | Draw the curtain close and let us all to meditation,[^206]
    | To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd moon.[^207]

#. 

    | My crown is call'd content. A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.[^208]
    | Silence bestows that virtue on it.[^209]

#. 

    | Time travels in divers paces with divers persons,[^210]
    | And, since I saw thee, th' affliction of my mind amends.[^211]

#. 

    | When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear,[^212]
    | These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear.[^213]

#. 

    | Burd'ned with like weight of pain,[^214]
    | Thou didst smile, infused with a fortitude from heaven.[^215]

#. 

    | This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath—[^216]
    | Was it not to refresh the mind of man?[^217]

#. 

    | So shaken as we are, so wan with care—[^218]
    | Awake, dear heart, awake; thou hast slept well. Awake![^219]

#. 

    | Enforce attention like deep harmony;[^220]
    | You shall find your safety manifested.[^221]

#. 

    | Hath not in nature's mystery more science[^222]
    | To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy?[^223]

#. 

    | How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature![^224]
    | Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful.[^225]

#. 

    | I will believe thou hast a mind that suits[^226]
    | And may enjoy such quiet walks as these.[^227]

#. 

    | Who doth ambition shun, and loves to live i' th' sun,[^228]
    | He finds the joys of heaven here on earth.[^229]

#. 

    | Enjoy thy plainness. It nothing ill becomes thee.[^230]
    | For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich.[^231]

#. 

    | Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?[^232]
    | Keep unshak'd that temple, thy fair mind.[^233]

#. 

    | Unlooked for joy in that I honour most:[^234]
    | Your bounty, virtue, fair humility.[^235]

#. 

    | Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things.[^236]
    | Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain.[^237]

#. 

    | For virtue's office never breaks men's troth,[^238]
    | Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste.[^239]

#. 

    | As Nature was in making graces dear,[^240]
    | Then happy I that love and am beloved.[^241]

#. 

    | You bear a gentle mind, and heav'nly blessings follow such creatures.[^242]
    | Steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution.
   [^243]

#. 

    | Do not infest your mind with beating on
    | The strangeness of this business;[^244]
    | It is the purpose that makes strong the vow.[^245]

#. 

    | A turn or two I'll walk to still my beating mind.[^246]
    | My crown is in my heart, not on my head.[^247]

#. 

    | That love which virtue begs and virtue grants[^248]
    | Is true of mind and made of no such baseness.[^249]

#. 

    | Your patience and your virtue well deserves it[^250]
    | That every eye which in this forest looks
    | Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.[^251]

#. 

    | Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace[^252]
    | And take thou my oblation, poor but free.[^253]

#. 

    | To make you understand this in a manifested effect:[^254]
    | Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.[^255]

#. 

    | The purest spring is not so free from mud;[^256]
    | It is the show and seal of nature's truth.[^257]

#. 

    | Comets, importing change of times and states—[^258]
    | O infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from
    | The world's great snare uncaught?[^259]

#. 

    | The very virtue of compassion in thee[^260]
    | Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.[^261]

#. 

    | You see how all conditions, how all minds tender down their services?[^262]
    | Silence is the perfectest herald of joy.[^263]

#. 

    | All of one nature, of one substance bred,[^264]
    | When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile![^265]

#. 

    | Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind,[^266]
    | Then music with her silver sound
    | With speedy help doth lend redress.[^267]

#. 

    | An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds[^268]
    | Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground.[^269]

#. 

    | One feast, one house, one mutual happiness,[^270]
    | With profits of the mind, study and fast.[^271]

#. 

    | The griefs are ended by seeing the worst,[^272]
    | Then sigh not so, but let them go.[^273]

#. 

    | To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell,[^274]
    | The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer.[^275]

#. 

    | Through the forest I have gone[^276]
    | To make some special instance special-blest.[^277]

#. 

    | Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun—[^278]
    | I'll be as patient as a gentle stream.[^279]

#. 

    | For I must tell you friendly in your ear:[^280]
    | The forest walks are wide and spacious.[^281]

#. 

    | As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,[^282]
    | Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.[^283]

#. 

    | Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,[^284]
    | 'The more I give to thee, the more I have.'[^285]

#. 

    | The sea all water, yet receives rain still—[^286]
    | God be thank'd, there is no need of me.[^287]

#. 

    | Out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety,[^288]
    | And make us heirs of all eternity.[^289]

#. 

    | That's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.[^290]
    | Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound to pity too.[^291]

#. 

    | Full many a glorious morning have I seen,[^292]
    | For I impair not beauty being mute.[^293]

#. 

    | A little fire is quickly trodden out;[^294]
    | All losses are restored, and sorrows end.[^295]

#. 

    | My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.[^296]
    | In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them.[^297]

#. 

    | Let's take the instant by the forward top[^298]
    | And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time.[^299]

#. 

    | One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.[^300]
    | A kingdom for it was too small a bound.[^301]

#. 

    | With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,[^302]
    | Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross.[^303]

#. 

    | Sweet are the uses of adversity[^304]
    | Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet.[^305]

#. 

    | Men of great worth resorted to this forest[^306]
    | As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea.[^307]
